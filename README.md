# xai
Explainable AI research repository.


## Background
This repository contains research work extending the explainable AI approach of the van der Schaar lab. 
See: `Crabb√©, J., Qian, Z., Imrie, F., & van der Schaar, M. (2021). Explaining latent representations with a corpus of examples. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`

Specifically, we seek to use the Simplex explainability approach to establish global confidence measures
to assess the appropriateness of a given model to a particular dataset.

Various experiments are run to explore the latent space and apply different distance measures based on Simplex
approximations. These are applied in two settings: MNIST handwritten digits and histopathological lung and colon
images to classify cancer.


## Dev environment setup
```shell
conda create -n xai python=3.11
conda activate xai
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install simplexai
pip install -e .
```

Compile requirements
```shell
pip install pip-tools

pip-compile requirements.in --upgrade
pip-compile requirements-dev.in --upgrade
```

### Style and Testing
Testing is done using `pytest`.

Docstrings conform to the [numpy docstring style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) 
and `flake8` is used to lint.
